/**
 * Record that works with moshi to create the internal audio features objects for the overall list
 * of feature objects.
 *
 * <p>Descriptions gotten directly from the Spotify API:
 * https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features
 *
 * @param acousticness A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0
 *     represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
 * @param danceability Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a
 *     combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall
 *     regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
 * @param duration_ms The duration of the track in milliseconds.
 * @param energy Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of
 *     intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
 * @param id The Spotify ID for the track.
 * @param instrumentalness Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are
 *     treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The
 *     closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no
 *     vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks.
 * @param key The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.
 *     E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
 * @param liveness Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values
 *     represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
 * @param loudness The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged
 *     across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is
 *     the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength
 *     (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.
 * @param mode Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which
 *     its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
 * @param speechiness Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more
 *     exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0
 *     the attribute value.
 * @param tempo The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).
 * @param time_signature An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational
 *     convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges
 *     from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4".
 * @param track_href A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.
 * @param valence A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
 *     TracksProp with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while
 *     tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
